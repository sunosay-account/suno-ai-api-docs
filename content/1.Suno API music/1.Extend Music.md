## Sample Parameters

```json
{
  "prompt": "Wandering through the hazy corridors of memory, 'Echoes of Solitude' weaves a tapestry of melancholic melodies that embrace the listener in a warm yet lonely embrace. The vocals, a soft whisper against the night, intertwine with the gentle strumming of an acoustic guitar, painting a picture of solitude that is both beautiful and haunting. Layers of ethereal synths rise and fall like the tide, carrying the song towards depths unknown, while the drums pulse with a distant, almost tribal rhythm, adding a touch of mystery to the already atmospheric soundscape. This is a track that embodies the quiet introspection of a soul seeking solace in the vastness of its own thoughts, a stylistic blend of dream-pop and indie-folk that lingers long after the final note fades away.",

  "title": "Echoes of Solitude",

  "continue_clip_id": "186001a9-a9e2-487a-bdcc-417914676f24",
